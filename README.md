# Skills Marketplace

A curated collection of reusable agent skills and rules. Each item is a self-contained directory that can be installed into any compatible AI agent tool.

**Skills** are invoked on demand (`/skill-name`). **Rules** are always-on and activate automatically every session.

## Catalog

### Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [autonomous-persistence](./rules/autonomous-persistence/) | Never ask permission to continue -- keep working autonomously until done or explicitly stopped |
| [blast-radius](./rules/blast-radius/) | Scope changes by blast radius — prefer small atomic edits over large risky rewrites |
| [continuous-improvement](./rules/continuous-improvement/) | Structured seven-phase workflow for finding, planning, and implementing codebase improvements |
| [document-lifecycle](./rules/document-lifecycle/) | Three-tier documentation: rules, reference, history — no sprawl |
| [document-progress](./rules/document-progress/) | Write progress to disk using todo lists and HANDOFF.md so nothing is lost between sessions |
| [improve-the-process](./rules/improve-the-process/) | Fix friction structurally — every session should improve the workflow |
| [no-ai-credit](./rules/no-ai-credit/) | Prevent AI agents from adding self-attribution to any output |
| [output-discipline](./rules/output-discipline/) | Redirect verbose output to files and extract only what you need -- never flood context |
| [pitfalls-discipline](./rules/pitfalls-discipline/) | Read PITFALLS.md before complex work, write to it after fixing bugs |
| [prior-art](./rules/prior-art/) | Search for existing solutions before building custom code |

| [revert-on-failure](./rules/revert-on-failure/) | Commit before experimenting, measure after, keep improvements, revert failures |
| [session-resilience](./rules/session-resilience/) | Write state to disk continuously — you don't have memory, these files do |
| [simplicity-bar](./rules/simplicity-bar/) | Weigh complexity cost against improvement magnitude -- simpler is better, deletion is a win |
| [stay-motivated](./rules/stay-motivated/) | Completeness checklist — verify done conditions before stopping |
| [task-formation](./rules/task-formation/) | Decompose requests into goals with intent, then into actionable session-sized tasks |
| [telegram-on-complete](./rules/telegram-on-complete/) | Send a Telegram notification after completing any task |
| [verification-ladder](./rules/verification-ladder/) | Five-layer automated testing: compile, unit, integration, perf, e2e |
| [verify-your-work](./rules/verify-your-work/) | Require agents to test and verify their work before declaring tasks complete |

## Interactive Installer

<p align="center">

</p>

### One-liner install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForkYoraiLevi/marketplace/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Installs `uv` if needed, clones the repo, and launches the interactive TUI. Pass arguments through:

```bash
curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --uninstall    # uninstall mode
curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --project      # project-level install
```

### From a local clone

The easiest way to install everything. Detects your agent platforms, shows checkboxes, installs your selections:

```bash
uv run install.py
```

Supports install and uninstall with a full TUI:

```bash
uv run install.py              # interactive install (global scope)
uv run install.py --uninstall  # interactive uninstall
uv run install.py --project    # install to project-level config
```

The installer handles MCP servers, rules, and skills across all detected platforms (Devin, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf). It shows what's already installed, skips duplicates, and uses the correct format for each platform.

## Manual Installation

### Rules

Rules activate automatically — no invocation needed. Each rule includes an install script and format-specific files for multiple agent tools.

```bash
# Install a rule into the current project (AGENTS.md only, the default)
rules/<rule-name>/install.sh

# Install globally (all projects)
rules/<rule-name>/install.sh --global

# Install for all tools at once (agents + windsurf + cursor)
rules/<rule-name>/install.sh --format all
```

Supported formats: `agents` (AGENTS.md, default), `windsurf`, `cursor`, `all`.

### Skills

Skills are invoked with `/<skill-name>` in an agent session. Copy the skill directory into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
cp -r skills/<skill-name> ~/.<agent>/skills/<skill-name>
# e.g. ~/.config/devin/skills/, ~/.windsurf/skills/, etc.
```
