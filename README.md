# Skills Marketplace

A curated collection of reusable agent skills and rules. Each item is a self-contained directory that can be installed into any compatible AI agent tool.

**Skills** are invoked on demand (`/skill-name`). **Rules** are always-on and activate automatically every session.

## Installing Rules

Rules activate automatically — no invocation needed. Each rule includes an install script and format-specific files for multiple agent tools.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ForkYoraiLevi/marketplace.git /tmp/marketplace

# Install a rule into the current project (all agent formats)
/tmp/marketplace/<rule-name>/install.sh

# Install globally (all projects)
/tmp/marketplace/<rule-name>/install.sh --global

# Install for a specific tool only
/tmp/marketplace/<rule-name>/install.sh --format windsurf
```

Supported formats: `agents` (AGENTS.md), `windsurf`, `cursor`, `claude`, `all` (default).

## Installing Skills

Skills are invoked with `/<skill-name>` in an agent session. Copy the skill directory into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ForkYoraiLevi/marketplace.git /tmp/marketplace
cp -r /tmp/marketplace/<skill-name> ~/.<agent>/skills/<skill-name>
# e.g. ~/.config/cognition/skills/, ~/.windsurf/skills/, etc.
```

Or into a project:

```bash
mkdir -p <project>/.windsurf/skills   # or .cognition/skills
cp -r /tmp/marketplace/<skill-name> <project>/.windsurf/skills/<skill-name>
```
