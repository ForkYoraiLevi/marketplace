# prior-art

An always-on rule that prevents AI agents from reinventing the wheel. Before building anything non-trivial, the agent must search for existing solutions — in the codebase, in project dependencies, and on the web — and report what it found.

Unlike a skill (which must be invoked), this is a **rule** — it activates automatically in every session with no user action needed.

## Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ForkYoraiLevi/marketplace.git /tmp/marketplace

# Install into current project (all agent formats)
/tmp/marketplace/prior-art/install.sh

# Install globally (all projects, all agent formats)
/tmp/marketplace/prior-art/install.sh --global

# Install for a specific tool only
/tmp/marketplace/prior-art/install.sh --format windsurf
/tmp/marketplace/prior-art/install.sh --format cursor
/tmp/marketplace/prior-art/install.sh --format agents
```

## Manual Install

### AGENTS.md (universal)

```bash
cat prior-art/rule.md >> AGENTS.md
```

### Windsurf

```bash
mkdir -p .windsurf/rules
cp prior-art/formats/windsurf.md .windsurf/rules/prior-art.md
```

### Cursor

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp prior-art/formats/cursor.md .cursor/rules/prior-art.md
```

## What it enforces

- **Search before building** — check the codebase, project dependencies, and the web for existing solutions before writing custom code
- **Evaluate what you find** — assess maintenance status, adoption, scope fit, license, quality, and security
- **Use a decision framework** — reuse exact matches, prefer well-maintained libraries, extend partial solutions, or build custom only when nothing suitable exists
- **Report findings** — always tell the user what you searched for and what you found, even if you end up building custom code
- **Know when to skip** — don't waste time searching for project-specific tasks like renaming variables or fixing typos

## How it works

| Format | File installed | Activation |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| AGENTS.md | `AGENTS.md` (appended) | Always on |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/prior-art.md` | `trigger: always_on` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/prior-art.md` | `alwaysApply: true` |
