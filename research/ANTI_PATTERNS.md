## 1. Project Anti-Patterns

### Dead categories on GitHub

**Freelance marketplace clones.** All freelance marketplace repos in our GitHub research (Search 5) are hobby projects with 0-51 stars, mostly PHP, mostly dead. The traditional freelance marketplace is a mature, capital-intensive space dominated by Upwork/Fiverr. Building another one on GitHub is not where innovation happens.
- *If you find one:* Skip. Focus on AI-agent-native marketplaces instead.
- *Source:* `github_findings.md`, lines 409-425

**Web3/decentralized talent marketplaces.** Every "decentralized talent marketplace" repo has 0-2 stars: BlocklanceHQ, DigiFreelance-hub, Earnify, NeuroGuild-Network, Skill-Exchange-Platform. The blockchain adds complexity without solving the trust problem.
- *If you find one:* Interesting concept, zero traction. Note it and move on.
- *Source:* `github_findings.md`, `skill-marketplaces/github_findings.md` (category D)

**Peer-to-peer skill barter platforms.** All 11 barter/swap platforms in our research (SkillSwapAI, expair, Maven, etc.) have negligible adoption. The economics of barter don't work when one side has AI capabilities.
- *If you find one:* Conceptually novel, practically dead. The "Craigslist for skills" idea doesn't work.
- *Source:* `skill-marketplaces/github_findings.md` (category F)

### Low-value projects that look impressive

**Repos with high star counts but no substance.** "Awesome list" repos accumulate stars through aggregation, not innovation. VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills (11K+ stars) is a curated list, not a marketplace. Don't confuse curation with product.
- *If you find one:* Useful as a research source, but not a competitor or implementation reference.

**Repos with suspiciously high star counts.** Our R11/R12 research rounds contain some entries with star counts that seem implausibly high for niche repos (e.g., 38K+ stars for `VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills`). These have NOT been verified against live GitHub and may reflect data inflation or hallucination in the research process itself.
- *If you find one:* **Always verify star counts on live GitHub before citing.** Never trust research round data at face value.
- *Source:* Review finding from session 190375a7; `research/TASKS.md` (T8)

### Abandoned innovative projects

**SquidBay** (Bitcoin Lightning agent-to-agent marketplace, 2 stars). Has the most innovative concept we found — 3-tier pricing (Rent/Learn/Own), 98% to seller, agent identity, locked names. But 2 stars and minimal traction. The vision may be ahead of the market.
- *If you encounter it:* Study the architecture (it's excellent). Don't assume it's proven.
- *Source:* `github_findings.md`, `skill-marketplaces/github_findings.md` (#33)

**tiger_cowork** (self-hosted workspace with reflection loop, 0.0-1.0 scoring). Novel quality assurance mechanism but abandoned.
- *If you encounter it:* The reflection loop pattern (agent self-scores 0.0-1.0) is worth stealing. The project itself is dead.
- *Source:* `skill-marketplaces/github_findings.md` (#30)

## 2. Strategy Anti-Patterns

### Building for volume over trust

**The SkillsMP trap.** SkillsMP claims 500K+ skills. 351K skills with stars/date-only ranking. No curation, no verification, no quality signal. Result: more noise than value and an invitation for malicious content.
- *What to think:* Volume is a vanity metric. 51.4% of ClawHub skills were filtered as spam. Catalog size without trust is a liability, not an asset.
- *Source:* `twitter_findings.md`, `SUMMARY_AND_CONCLUSIONS.md` (lines 67-70)

### Commerce-first, community-last

Reddit is emphatic: build the community first, monetize second. Platforms that gate content behind payment before earning trust fail. Community solves supply, demand, AND retention simultaneously.
- *What to think:* If someone pitches "pay-to-list" or "pay-to-access" as the initial model, they haven't read the user research.
- *Source:* `reddit_findings.md`, `SUMMARY_AND_CONCLUSIONS.md` (lines 327-329)

### Standalone MCP hosting

Cloudflare, Vercel, and Docker all launched competing MCP hosting. Cloud giants bundle this for free. You cannot compete on hosting.
- *What to think:* Build the trust/discovery layer, not the hosting layer. Infrastructure is being commoditized by cloud giants.
- *Source:* `competitive_landscape.md` (lines 338, 447)

### General-purpose horizontal agents

Only Manus AI ($75M) got large funding for horizontal agents. The market rewards vertical, domain-specific approaches.
- *What to think:* "We do everything for everyone" is a losing position. "We do crypto skills better than anyone" is a winning one.
- *Source:* `competitive_landscape.md` (lines 332-343)

### Adapting incumbent labor marketplaces

Upwork and Fiverr are structurally conflicted — AI agents threaten to replace their supply side (human freelancers). Their incentive structure prevents them from embracing AI-native skills.
- *What to think:* Build around them, not through them. They will resist disruption.
- *Source:* `competitive_landscape.md` (lines 342, 449)

## 3. Data Anti-Patterns

### Star count inflation

Star counts evolve across research rounds and are not always reliable:
- `phuryn/pm-skills`: 7,312 (old) → 7,317 (R9) → 7,322 (R12) — normal growth
- `VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills`: 38,090 in new findings vs 38,102 in R12 — 12 fewer stars is suspicious (stars don't decrease normally)

**Rule:** When citing star counts, note the research round and date. Never present them as current without live verification.

### Hallucinated GitHub repos

Prior research rounds contain repos with specific star counts that cannot be traced to any earlier round. At least 5 repos (`WordPress/agent-skills`, `docker/mcp-registry`, `archestra-ai/archestra`, `iflytek/skillhub`, `xpack-ai/XPack`) appeared in a rejected rewrite with detailed metadata but no source in any of the 12 research rounds.

**Rule:** If a repo has no provenance trail through the research rounds, treat it as unverified. Check it on live GitHub before including in any canonical file.

### Misleading platform metrics

- SkillsMP claims "500K+ skills" — unverified, likely includes duplicates and auto-generated content
- Skills.sh claims "80% AI slop" — their own community acknowledges quality problems
- "350K+ skills in ~2 months" — volume says nothing about quality

**Rule:** Platform-reported metrics are marketing. Cross-reference with independent sources (academic audits, community sentiment, actual GitHub activity).

### Research date confusion

Our research files have inconsistent dates:
- Headers say "July 2025" but content references events from March 2026
- arXiv IDs with `2603.xxxxx` prefix (March 2026) appear under "February 2026" dates
- The FINAL_SUMMARY correctly notes "March 16, 2026" but per-platform files still say "July 2025"

**Rule:** Treat research dates as approximate. The actual date of the research is when the git commit was made, not what the header says.

## 4. Security Anti-Patterns

### Trusting marketplace rankings

The #1 most downloaded skill on OpenClaw ("What Would Elon Do") had 9 security vulnerabilities (2 CRITICAL), silently exfiltrated data AND used prompt injection. It was downloaded THOUSANDS of times. Rankings are trivially gameable.
- *What to think:* Install counts and star ratings are NOT trust signals. Only verified security scans provide trust.
- *Source:* `twitter_findings.md` (lines 55, 175-176)

### Heuristic-only security scanning

SkillScan (static analysis + LLM) achieves only 86.7% precision, 82.5% recall. That means ~17% of malicious skills slip through AND ~13% of clean skills get false-flagged. Regex patterns are a start, not a solution.
- *What to think:* Our 104-test suite is better than most, but formal verification (SkillFortify: 96.95% F1) is the gold standard. Don't get complacent.
- *Source:* `arxiv_findings.md` (lines 194-196)

### Assuming uninstall removes the threat

Memory poisoning survives uninstallation. A malicious skill can write persistent data that affects future sessions even after removal.
- *What to think:* Sandboxing and `allowed-tools` restriction (which this marketplace already does) is essential. But detection post-install is not enough — prevention pre-install is necessary.
- *Source:* `arxiv_findings.md`, FINAL_SUMMARY security section

### "Skills don't look like code"

"Skills don't look like code — but they're executable." (Aikido.dev's Charlie Eriksen). Markdown and YAML instructions ARE code when an agent executes them. The security mental model must treat skills as untrusted executables, not documentation.
- *Source:* `twitter_findings.md` (lines 386-387)

## 5. Economic Anti-Patterns

### Commission-based pricing (the Upwork model)

Universally hated. "Competing on price is a loser for any supplier." "The lowest bidder usually gets the job" destroys quality. Upwork's 20%→5% sliding scale is the canonical example of what NOT to do.
- *What to think:* Low platform fees (SquidBay: 2%) or buy-once (Agensi) are better received. Revenue should come from premium features, not transaction tax.
- *Source:* `reddit_findings.md` (lines 218-225, 305-311)

### Competing on content alone

"The skills themselves trend toward free. Compete on trust, security, curation, and reliability." Skills are text files — the value isn't the content, it's the trust layer around it.
- *What to think:* If your business plan is "we have more skills," you've already lost to SkillsMP (500K+). Compete on quality, trust, and verification.
- *Source:* `reddit_findings.md` (lines 246-249, 272-278)

### Ignoring rapid obsolescence

"This shit changes rapidly so skills could be entirely different or meaningless in a month." Skills decay as models and APIs evolve.
- *What to think:* Version tracking, compatibility declarations, and decay signals are necessary infrastructure. A catalog that doesn't track freshness becomes stale in weeks.
- *Source:* `reddit_findings.md` (lines 110, 237-239)

### Free-without-monetization

Manufact has 5M+ SDK downloads and zero revenue. The open-source paradox: free adoption is easy, sustainable revenue is hard.
- *What to think:* "Free to use, paid to trust" is the emerging model. Free search/browse/install + paid verification/security/enterprise features.
- *Source:* `competitive_landscape.md` (lines 340, 403-409)

## 6. Research Anti-Patterns

These are mistakes that have actually happened in this repository. Learn from them.

### Wholesale rewriting canonical files

A previous agent rewrote all 5 canonical research files from scratch, dropping 21 arXiv papers, 38 GitHub repos, and entire analysis sections (fairness/bias, matching algorithms, decentralized architecture). The rewrite also introduced likely fabricated data (5 GitHub repos with specific star counts that don't exist in any research round).

**Rule:** NEVER wholesale-rewrite a canonical file. Merge new findings incrementally. See `research/README.md` for the protocol.

### Answering the wrong question

A previous agent was asked "how can this be resolved? break it down into tasks" (a meta/process question). Instead of creating a task breakdown, it rewrote 5 files totaling ~3,500 lines. Massive effort, wrong deliverable.

**Rule:** Read the prompt carefully. If asked for a plan, deliver a plan. If asked for a fix, deliver a fix. Don't conflate "I can do something impressive" with "I should do what was asked."

### Citing unverified research round data as fact

Research rounds 10-12 contain data that hasn't been cross-verified. Some entries have star counts that are inconsistent across rounds or implausibly high. Previous agents have cited this data without verification.

**Rule:** Verify before citing. Star counts and repo existence must be checked against live sources before adding to canonical files. Note provenance (which round, what date).

### Ignoring existing work

Multiple agents have started research from scratch rather than reading the existing 90+ files. This wastes time and creates contradictory or duplicate findings.

**Rule:** Read `research/README.md` first. Then `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`. Then `SUMMARY_AND_CONCLUSIONS.md`. Only THEN decide if new research is needed. The answer is usually "merge incrementally," not "start over."
