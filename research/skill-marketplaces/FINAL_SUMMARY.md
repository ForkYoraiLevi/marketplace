- **"Friction is a feature"** - Moltbook collapsed because interactions were too cheap
- **Skill monetization existentially challenged** - $26.48 invested in 7 agents → $0 revenue in Week 1. "Distribution is the hard problem, not production"
- **Narrative shift: "Build trust layer, not marketplace"** - Four documented shifts: marketplace→trust layer, sell skills→sell execution, agent marketplace→agent infrastructure, exciting→"npm but worse"
- **A2A Protocol moving to production** - Box, Salesforce, municipal governments piloting

**Pricing consensus (from 170+ comments):**
| Model | Description | Who Uses It |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Outcome-based | Pay per result | Sales agents |
| Action-based | Credits per run ($3-12) | Most B2C builders |
| Hybrid | Base + performance kicker | Enterprise |
| Machine-based | $99/mo per deployment + 20% token markup | Simple, scales poorly |

### 2.4 arXiv (90+ papers analyzed across R1-R9)

**Landmark papers:**

| Paper | ID | Key Finding |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| **COALESCE** | 2506.01900 | First skill-based labour exchange; 41.8% cost reduction |
| **ACES** | 2508.02630 | Agent buyers have 10-30x first-proposal bias, choice homogeneity |
| **Magentic Marketplace** | Microsoft | Quality degrades as agent count scales |
| **SkillFortify** | 2603.00195 | Formal verification; 96.95% F1 with 0% false positives |

3. Model scaling does NOT solve skill security (FASA, Skill-Inject)
4. Quality beats quantity - curated skills improve success; self-generated may degrade it
5. A single malicious actor accounts for 54.1% of all skill attacks
6. Hybrid trust (Proof+Stake+Reputation) needed — no single mechanism suffices (3 independent papers)
7. First-proposal bias (10-30x) makes agent marketplace UX design critical (Magentic Marketplace)

## 3. The Security Crisis (Quantified)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Skills with security flaws (Snyk audit) | 36.82% of 3,984 scanned | Snyk ToxicSkills |
| Critical-level security issues | 13.4% (534 skills) | Snyk ToxicSkills |
| Skills with at least one vulnerability | 26-41% | Multiple studies |
| Confirmed malicious skills (total) | 1,184+ | Stable-Learn / HackerNews |
| ClawHavoc campaign | 341 malicious skills; #1 download was malware | Reddit / HackerNews |
| Malicious skills detected by Gen Trust Hub | 12,000+ | Gen Digital |
| Users protected by Gen Trust Hub | 60 million+ | Gen Digital |
| Malicious tools catalogued (MalTool) | 6,487 | arXiv 2603.00195 |
| Attack success rate on frontier models | 80% | Skill-Inject benchmark |
| Credential theft from single fake skill | 6K+ users | Reddit/caterpillar scanner |
| OpenClaw instances worldwide | 63,026 | GitHub security report |
| Data exfiltration prevalence | 13.3% of all skills | Multiple |
| Third-party content injection | 17.7% of skills | Multiple |
| Malicious skills with code exploits | 100% | Snyk ToxicSkills |
| Malicious skills also using prompt injection | 91% | Snyk ToxicSkills |

**Why agent skills are worse than package ecosystems:**
- Traditional packages: isolated execution. Agent skills: **full agent permissions** (shell, filesystem, env vars, email)
- New attack vectors with no package-ecosystem analog: **prompt injection, memory poisoning, time-shifted payload assembly**
- Memory poisoning **survives uninstallation, agent restarts, and platform updates**

## 4. The Five Architectural Layers

Every viable skill marketplace must address all 5:

```
+------------------------------------------+
|  5. GOVERNANCE                           |  Singapore IMDA, IEEE P3709,
|     Compliance, identity, audit          |  OWASP Agentic Top 10, COMPASS
+------------------------------------------+
|  4. ORCHESTRATION                        |  A2A Protocol (30+ impls),
|     Multi-agent coordination             |  SkillOrchestra, AWCP
+------------------------------------------+
|  3. PAYMENTS                             |  x402, Stripe AgentPay,
|     Pricing, billing, escrow             |  Mastercard, crypto micropayments
+------------------------------------------+
|  2. TRUST                                |  AgentVerus, SkillJury, Conduit,
|     Validation, reputation, QA           |  Ev-Trust, ClawSecure
+------------------------------------------+
|  1. DISCOVERY                            |  SkillsMP, skills.sh, SKILL.md,
|     Search, recommendation               |  ChainRec, semantic search
+------------------------------------------+
```

**No single project covers all 5 layers. The first to integrate them wins.**

## 6. Key Conclusions

### What's Working
1. **SKILL.md is the standard** - Format war is over. All 4 major vendors converged.
2. **Vertical specialization wins** - PM (7,311 stars), security (3,589), crypto (462), legal (176)
3. **Discovery is solved at the basic level** - Multiple marketplaces with 10K+ skills
4. **A2A protocol gaining real traction** - 30+ implementations, Fortune 500 piloting

### What's Broken
1. **Security is catastrophically bad** - 1 in 4 skills has a vulnerability
2. **No integrated trust layer** - Trust is fragmented across 6+ partial solutions
3. **Production gap** - 71% deploy, only 11% reach production
4. **Agent buyers are terrible** - 10-30x first-proposal bias, gaming vulnerability
5. **Prompt governance doesn't work** - Zero reliable benefit (academic proof)
6. **Marketplace fatigue** - Too many overlapping, undifferentiated marketplaces

### What's Missing (Biggest Opportunities)
1. **Full-stack marketplace integrating all 5 layers** - Discovery + Trust + Payments + Orchestration + Governance
2. **Agent-native discovery** - Current UX is for humans; agents need different ranking
3. **Insurance/failure recovery** - InsuredAgents paper exists but no production implementation
4. **Skill versioning and dependency resolution** - SKILL.md needs semver + lockfiles
5. **Cross-marketplace portability** - Skills are locked to individual marketplaces
6. **Agent DNS/registry** - No universal agent identity/discovery standard
7. **Anti-gaming infrastructure** - ToolTweak shows 20% -> 81% manipulation is trivial

---

## 7. Strategic Recommendations

### If You're Building a Skill Marketplace:

**Do:**
1. **Start with trust, not discovery** - "The marketplace that solves trust first wins"
2. **Pick a vertical and go deep** - Horizontal aggregation is saturated (400K+ undifferentiated skills)
3. **Implement runtime governance, not prompts** - Only governance graphs + runtime enforcement works
4. **Build for agent buyers, not human browsers** - Anti-first-proposal-bias, anti-gaming
5. **Adopt SKILL.md + semver + lockfiles** - The standard is settled; add versioning
6. **Price on outcomes, not seats** - "SaaS metrics are dead for agentic ecosystems"
7. **Add friction intentionally** - Moltbook collapsed because interactions were too cheap

**Don't:**
1. Don't chase volume - 400K skills exist, 90%+ undifferentiated
2. Don't trust model scaling for security - 80% attack success even on frontier models
3. Don't rely on prompt-based governance - Proven zero benefit
4. Don't auto-generate skills naively - Only evolutionary approaches work
5. Don't ignore regulation - Colorado SB 24-205 effective June 30, 2026

### The Winning Architecture (Predicted):

```
Agent requests capability
  -> Discovery layer: semantic SKILL.md search + agent-optimized ranking
  -> Trust layer: AgentVerus-style certification + runtime scanning
  -> Payment layer: outcome-based pricing with escrow
  -> Orchestration layer: A2A + SkillOrchestra competence matrices
  -> Governance layer: runtime enforcement + audit logs + compliance
```

## 9. The Big Picture

The skill marketplace space in March 2026 looks remarkably similar to the **npm ecosystem circa 2015** - explosive growth, terrible security, competing registries, nascent monetization. But with one critical difference: **agent skills execute with full system permissions**, making the security stakes orders of magnitude higher.

The three forces that will determine winners:
1. **Trust** - Who solves verification, scanning, and reputation first
2. **Agent-native design** - Who builds for agent buyers (not human browsers)
3. **Governance** - Who integrates compliance as a product (not an afterthought)

The marketplace that integrates all 5 architectural layers (Discovery + Trust + Payments + Orchestration + Governance) into a coherent product will likely become the dominant platform - much as npm, PyPI, and Docker Hub became dominant in their respective ecosystems.

**The window is open. The standards are set. The security crisis creates urgency. Build now.**
